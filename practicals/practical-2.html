    <p>
        Front-end development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically 
        it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML ), Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) and JavaScript portion of web 
        site production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It emcompasses everything from building a 
        simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various 
        different browsers, devices and screen sizes.
