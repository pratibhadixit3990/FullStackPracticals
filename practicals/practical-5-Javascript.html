        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for 
        the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for 
        Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a standard library 
        of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control 
        structures, and statements.
